Goal: Put this repository on GitHub without using any code tools.

Steps (web only):
1) Go to github.com and sign in (or create an account).
2) Click "New" repository. Name it: project-biryani (or anything you like). Keep default settings.
3) On the repo page, click "Add file" → "Upload files".
4) Drag-and-drop all folders/files from this package (README.md, /spec, /app, /server, .gitignore, .github/).
5) Click "Commit changes". You now have a GitHub repo.

Optional (GitHub Desktop, easier updates):
- Install GitHub Desktop. Click "File → New repository" and choose a folder.
- Copy these files into that folder. Commit → Publish repository.

Next:

- Share the repo link with your dev(s).
