# Project Biryani — Phase 2 (Version 1)

This repository holds the **locked v1 spec** and a lightweight scaffold to help developers build the app.

## Contents
- `/spec/Final_Build_v1.txt` — authoritative build request.
- `/app/` — client app folder (PWA or React Native).
- `/server/` — backend/sync mock folder.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — ready-to-use GitHub Issue templates.

## TL;DR for Developers
- Offline-first; button-only UI; evidence-gated flows (photo + voice); voids need video.
- NCR stays red until manager clears; tolerance = 20%.
- Short IDs/filenames; offline stubs rename on sync.
- See `/spec/Final_Build_v1.txt` for acceptance criteria.

## Getting Started (no coding required)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Upload all files/folders from this package.
